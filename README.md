# Behavior Tree Plugin

This plugin allows you to create complex AI behaviors using a tree of nodes.
It uses a `GraphEdit` to edit the tree instead of the common Node-based approach, making it easier to use and better integrated into Godot.

## Usage

To add a behavior tree to a node, enable the plugin and add a `BehaviourTreePlayer`. An editor similar to the visual shader editor will show up in the bottom panel where you can edit the behavior tree.
